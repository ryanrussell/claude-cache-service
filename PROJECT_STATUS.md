# Project Status: Claude Cache Service

**Status**: ON HOLD  
**Reason**: Subscription Incompatibility  
**Date**: July 8, 2024

## Summary

This project was developed to create a caching service for Claude API responses to reduce costs and improve performance when analyzing SDK codebases. However, we discovered that the service requires an Anthropic API key, which is a separate product from Claude Pro/Max subscriptions.

## Key Findings

### Subscription Model Confusion

1. **Claude Pro/Max**: Consumer subscriptions for claude.ai web interface
2. **Anthropic API**: Separate developer product requiring API keys and pay-per-token pricing
3. **Claude Code/CLI**: Uses its own authentication, doesn't expose prompt caching

### Technical Limitations

- Prompt caching is only available through the Anthropic SDK/API
- Claude Code/CLI only offers `--continue` and `--resume` for session management
- No way to leverage prompt caching with consumer subscriptions

## Implementation Progress

### Completed (PRs Merged)

1. **Issue #1**: Claude API Client Implementation
   - Full retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Rate limiting
   - Token counting
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **Issue #2**: Real SDK Analysis and Update Worker
   - Git integration using go-git
   - SDK configuration for 29 Sentry SDKs
   - Batch processing for cost optimization
   - Fallback to mock analyzer when API key not configured

### Not Started (Due to Hold)

3. **Issue #3**: Real Analytics Collection and Storage
4. **Issue #4**: WebSocket Real-Time Updates
5. **Issue #5**: Authentication and Authorization
6. **Issue #6**: Rate Limiting
7. **Issue #7**: Go Client Library
8. **Issue #8**: TypeScript/JavaScript Client Library
9. **Issue #9**: Cache Refresh Endpoint

## Code Quality

- **Test Coverage**: 48.7% overall
  - config: 100%
  - analyzer: 86.4%
  - api: 72.4%
  - cache: 70%
  - git: 60.4%
- **Linting**: Clean (0 issues with golangci-lint)
- **Error Handling**: 75 error checks implemented

## Future Options

### If Anthropic API Access Becomes Available

The service is ready to use with minimal configuration:
1. Set `CLAUDE_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Run `go run cmd/server/main.go`
3. Access API at `http://localhost:8080`

### Alternative Approaches Without API

1. **Local Context Management**: Build a tool that optimizes prompts for Claude Code/CLI
2. **Session Manager**: Enhanced wrapper around `--continue` and `--resume`
3. **Prompt Templates**: Library of optimized prompts for common tasks
4. **File-based Caching**: Cache analysis results locally without API calls

## Lessons Learned

1. Always verify API/subscription requirements before building
2. Consumer products (Claude Pro) != Developer products (API)
3. Claude Code/CLI is powerful but limited to its exposed features
4. Prompt caching would provide significant value if accessible

## Repository State

- All code is functional and tested
- Documentation updated with compatibility warnings
- Ready to resume if API access becomes available
- Can be forked/modified for alternative approaches
